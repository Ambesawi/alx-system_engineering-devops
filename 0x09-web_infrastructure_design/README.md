# Web Infrastructure Design

## Description

This project focuses on understanding and designing the web infrastructure. The tasks involve whiteboarding diagrams that cover the web stack built with sysadmin/devops track projects. Each component's functionality and the concept of system redundancy are explained. Acronyms such as LAMP, SPOF, and QPS are familiarized.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Draw a diagram covering the web stack built with sysadmin/devops track projects.
- Explain the functionality of each component in the web stack.
- Understand and explain the concept of system redundancy.
- Familiarize yourself with acronyms such as LAMP, SPOF, and QPS.
