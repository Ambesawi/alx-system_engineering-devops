# Command Line for the Win

## Overview

CMD CHALLENGE is a command-line game designed to enhance Bash skills. The game consists of tasks that need to be completed using the command line, and the complexity of questions increases progressively. This project is optional and aimed at improving command-line proficiency.

## Requirements

### General

- A `README.md` file at the root of the project folder is mandatory.
- This project will undergo manual review.
- Each completed task will be indicated by the turning green of the task's name.
- Create and push a screenshot, demonstrating the completion of required levels, to GitHub in either PNG or JPEG format.

### Specific

In addition to completing the project tasks and submitting the required screenshots to GitHub, you are required to demonstrate the use of the SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol) command-line tool to move your local screenshots to the sandbox environment.

#### Steps:

1. Take screenshots of the completed levels as mentioned in the general requirements.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt on your local machine.
3. Use the SFTP command-line tool to establish a connection to the sandbox environment (hostname, username, and password provided).
4. Navigate to the directory where you want to upload the screenshots.
5. Use the SFTP `put` command to upload the screenshots from your local machine to the sandbox environment.
6. Confirm the successful transfer by checking the sandbox directory.
7. Once transferred, proceed to push the screenshots to GitHub as mentioned in the initial requirements.

Ensure that you include the steps you followed to use the SFTP command-line tool in your projectâ€™s `README.md` file. This will help reviewers understand how you performed the file transfer using SFTP.

**Note:** Screenshots of completed levels should be inside the directory `/root/alx-system_engineering-devops/command_line_for_the_win/`.
